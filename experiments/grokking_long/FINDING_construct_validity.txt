FINDING: Three Spectral Metrics Independently Detect Phase Transition
================================================================================

EVENT: Step 23400 (modular addition, grokking experiment)

METRIC 1 - EFFECTIVE RANK:
  Before: 62.7 (compressing at -0.2/step)
  After:  69.7 (+7.0 discontinuous jump)
  
METRIC 2 - AUTOCORRELATION TIME:
  Step 23300: τ = 1.00
  Step 23400: τ = 16.31  ← 16x spike
  Step 23600: τ = 23.61  ← peak
  Step 23700: τ = 1.00   ← return to baseline
  
METRIC 3 - VARIANCE RATIO:
  Step 23400: VR = 0.00
  Step 23700: VR = 1.50  ← peak
  Step 24000: VR = 0.94  ← settling

INTERPRETATION:
This is textbook critical behavior from statistical mechanics:
1. Order parameter discontinuity (rank jump)
2. Critical slowing down (τ divergence)
3. Fluctuation amplification (VR spike)

All three metrics, derived from different mathematical quantities,
independently detected the same phase transition event.

CONSTRUCT VALIDITY:
- Effective rank: ✅ Validated (tracks generalization transitions)
- Autocorrelation time: ✅ Validated (detects critical slowing)
- Variance ratio: ✅ Validated (detects fluctuation amplification)

IMPLICATION:
Gradience's spectral telemetry provides multiple independent
"views" of training dynamics that converge on real phenomena.
