PART 1: VALIDATED METRICS
================================================================================

METRIC                  | VALIDATED | INTERPRETATION
------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------
Effective Rank          | ✅ Yes    | Tracks representation complexity
Rank Compression        | ✅ Yes    | Smooth compression = healthy grokking
Rank Oscillation        | ✅ Yes    | Indicates struggling/stuck model
κ (condition number)    | ⚠️ Nuanced| Not instability predictor; tracks strain
κ Recovery Ratio        | ✅ Yes    | High recovery = healthy (necessary not sufficient)
Autocorrelation τ       | ✅ Yes    | Spikes at phase transitions
Variance Ratio          | ✅ Yes    | Amplifies at critical points

PART 2: KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

FINDING 1: Rank Compression as Learning Signature
- Grokking exhibits 67% rank compression (175 → 58)
- Smooth compression correlates with successful generalization
- Oscillation indicates failed compression attempts

FINDING 2: κ Recovery Predicts (But Doesn't Guarantee) Success
- κ_recovery = κ_max / κ_current
- Low recovery (<2x) → almost certainly failing
- High recovery (>5x) → necessary but not sufficient for success

FINDING 3: Phase Transitions Have Statistical Mechanics Signatures
- Autocorrelation time τ: 1 → 16 → 24 → 1 at generalization event
- Variance ratio spikes at same point
- Three independent metrics converge on phase boundaries

FINDING 4: Signatures Are Regime-Specific
- Grokking: Rank compression, κ recovery matter
- Standard supervised (CNN): κ ≈ 2, stable rank is healthy
- Different architectures need different interpretations

FINDING 5: Layer Selection Matters
- CNNs: Monitor conv layers (κ ≈ 2 healthy), FC is trivial
- MLPs: All layers informative
- Metric aggregation must be architecture-aware

PART 3: PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

EARLY STOPPING RULES:

For Grokking/Algorithmic Tasks:
- KILL if: κ_recovery < 2 at 30% of expected training
- KILL if: Rank oscillation > 5 sign changes in first 20%
- CONTINUE if: Smooth compression + κ_recovery > 5

For Standard Supervised Learning:
- ALERT if: Conv layer κ > 10 (unusual, investigate)
- HEALTHY if: κ stable at 2-3, rank near full
- Standard loss-based stopping still applies

For Fine-tuning (from prior work):
- HEALTHY: Quick complexity plateau ("equilibrium")
- UNHEALTHY: Vertical complexity spike ("memorization")

================================================================================
PART 4: LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. κ alone is not predictive of instability
2. High κ_recovery necessary but not sufficient for success
3. Hessian estimation breaks on transformer attention layers
4. Need architecture-specific interpretation guides
5. Findings validated on small models; large-scale TBD
