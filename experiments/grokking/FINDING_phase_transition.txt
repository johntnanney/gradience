FINDING: Spectral Signature of Generalization Onset

Dataset: Modular addition (p=97)
Event: Step 23300 → 23400

BEFORE (steady memorization):
- Effective rank: decreasing at -0.2/100 steps
- Test accuracy: ~3.4% (near random)

AT TRANSITION:
- Rank: 62.7 → 69.7 (+11% discontinuous jump)
- Test: 3.4% → 6.8% (doubled)

AFTER:
- Rank stabilized ~69, then resumed compression
- Test peaked at 7.4%, declined to ~5%

INTERPRETATION:
This appears to be a "failed grok" or precursor oscillation.
The rank jump coincided precisely with generalization improvement,
suggesting effective rank is an order parameter for the 
memorization → generalization phase transition.

NEXT: Run to 150k steps to observe full grokking.
