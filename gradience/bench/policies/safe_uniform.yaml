# Safe Uniform Baseline Policy - Machine-Consumable Export
# Generated from empirical validation results and VALIDATION_POLICY.md

policy_version: "0.1"
policy_name: "Safe Uniform Baseline Policy"
generated_date: "2025-01-14"

scope:
  model_family: "distilbert"
  task: "glue/sst2"
  architecture: "transformer-encoder"

validation:
  level: "screening_plus"  # Limited seeds but full training budget
  steps: "500"
  seeds: 3  # target for Certifiable level
  current_seeds: 1  # actual validation completed

criteria:
  # Safe uniform baseline = ≥67% seeds PASS AND worst seed Δ≥-2.5%
  pass_rate_min: 0.67
  worst_delta_min: -0.025  # worst case accuracy drop threshold
  
recommendations:
  # Policy-compliant uniform compression ranks
  primary_uniform_rank: 20  # 25.0% compression, policy-compliant
  conservative_uniform_rank: 24  # 16.6% compression, ultra-safe
  avoid_uniform_ranks: [16]  # 0% pass rate, policy violation

empirical_evidence:
  # Results from completed benchmark validation

    status: "SAFE"

fallback_strategy:
  # If no uniform baseline meets safety criteria
  default_recommendation: "per_layer_adaptive"
  fallback_reason: "No policy-compliant uniform compression found"

limitations:
  - "Task/model specific: Re-validate for new model families or tasks"
  - "Validation level: Screening+ (needs multi-seed for Certifiable)"
  - "Single dataset: Results specific to SST-2, may not generalize"
  - "Training budget: 500 steps may not reflect longer training scenarios"

next_steps:
  - "Multi-seed validation (3+ seeds) for Certifiable status"  
  - "Extended task validation (other GLUE tasks)"
  - "Model family validation (RoBERTa, BERT variants)"
  - "Production workload validation"

usage_notes:
  - "Load this policy in `gradience check` for automated compliance"
  - "Override policy thresholds based on application requirements"
  - "Track policy violations and update based on production data"
